		<a name="qa1"></a><b>What is Schedu-elp?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>Schedu-elp is a tool created to help Santa Clara University graduate students research and review classes they plan on 
			taking and have taken, respectively.  Looking through a college course catalog can be time consuming, especially for 
			working graduate students who have families and other responsibilities.  With Schedu-elp, students can search through a
			database of classes offered based on different criteria that is most suitable to them, without having to read through pages
			pages of a course catalog.</p><br/>
		<a name="qa2"></a><b>Is it free?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>YES!  Schedu-elp was designed to accomodate students, so of course it is free.</p><br/>
		<a name="qa3"></a><b>Can anyone use Schedu-elp?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>Yes and No.  Although Schedu-elp is intended to help  Santa Clara University graduate students (at the moment), anyone can 
			do a search for classes.  However, in order to sign in and create a program of study, you need to be a SCU graduate student.  
			We hope to provide wider coverage to accommodate undergraduate students in the future.</p><br/>
		<a name="qa4"></a><b>Does Schedu-elp work for other schools?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>No.  Schedu-elp is only for classes given/taken at Santa Clara University.</p><br/>
		<a name="qa5"></a><b>How do I sign in?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>First, go to the top right corner of the Schedu-elp home page and click on "Sign In"".  You will be prompted to enter your 
			SCU student identification number.  Your SCU student ID should start with a "W", followed by 7 digits.  Your password is your 
			Novell password.  If you are unsure what your Novell password is, you can find it on Ecampus, under Personal Portfolio > SCU 
			Electronic Information.</p><br/>
		<a name="qa6"></a><b>How do I change my password?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>Right now, the Schedu-elp system only allows the sign in option with your SCU student ID and corresponding Novell password.  
			If you would like to change your password, you would have to change your Novell password.  You can do this on Ecampus, under 
			Personal Portfolio > SCU Electronic Information, the same place you go to find your Novell password.</p><br/>
		<a name="qa7"></a><b>What criteria can I use to search for a class?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>You can search for a class with a number of different criteria.  The options available are:<br/>
		<p style="text-indent: 5em;">Course Code</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 5em;">Course Name</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 5em;">Course Availability</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 10em;">Day offered</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 10em;">Time offered</p>
		<p>Soon you will also be able to search for a class using criteria such as:</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 5em;">Materials used for class</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 5em;">Prerequisites for a particular class</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 5em;">Nature of course work</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 10em;">Group</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 10em;">Individual</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 5em;">Momentum of workload</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 5em;">Participation</p>
		<p style="text-indent: 5em;">Special requirements</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 10em;">Issues in Professional Practice</p>
			<p style="text-indent: 10em;">Science, Technology, Society (STS) Minor</p>
		</p>
		<br/>
		<a name="qa8"></a><b>How do I search for a class?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>To seach for a class, enter at least one criteria: course code, course name, day(s) offered, or course timings.  Course code 
		is the specific code used to identify the class.  For example "COEN 285".  Course name can be either the exact course name, like
		"Software Engineering" or it can be a word or words that occur in the course name (i.e. "computer").  Click on the button(s) of 
		which days you'd like the class to be offered on.  And for course timing, input the time range that you'd like the course to be in.
		All you have to do is enter one critera, but for a more advanced search you can enter several criteria.  When your criteria has been
		entered, click on the ""Search" button and your results will be listed on the right side of the page.</p><br/>
		<a name="qa9"></a><b>What is a program of study?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>A program of study is the list of classes that you have taken or plan on taking to complete your degree.</p><br/>
		<a name="qa10"></a><b>How do I post a review?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>To post a review, </p><br/>
		<a name="qa11"></a><b>Are the reviews filtered?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>No.  The reviews are not filtered, so please keep all reviews professional.</p><br/>
		<a name="qa12"></a><b>Am I allowed to write a negative review?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>Yes.  All reviews, whether they are positive or negative, are allowed.</p><br/>
		<a name="qa13"></a><b>Can teachers comment on the reviews?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>No.  Teachers cannot comment on the reviews.  But they can view the reviews.  </p><br/>
		<a name="qa14"></a><b>Can I make an anonymous review?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>No.  You must be signed in to make a review, so your student ID will appear at the end of your review.</p><br/>
		<a name="qa15"></a><b>Can I write a review if I am not a student?</b><br/><br/>
		<p>No.  You must be a registered student with a student ID to write a review.  But if you are not a student, you can still 
		view the reviews.</p><br/>
