Team: Poornima Ganesan, Shradha Gavali, Sheila Castillo

#TECHNOLOGIES

#ABOUT THE PROJECT
The Schedu-elp concept was developed out of recognition that there was not an existing online resource 
to help the working graduate community plan their education. The Schedu-elp tool allows for the users to 
access course overviews, course reviews, search on a subset of content to aid with planning purposes, and 
create a Program of Studies which can simply be printed prior to obtaining advisor’s approval, all while 
adhering to program requirements – streamlining the course curriculum and saving educational expenses. 	
Following are the user stories supported by Scheduelp:
* Access Homepage: shows overview of Schedu-elp web app
* Student sign-in/sign out
* Course search by course name, course number, course schedule
* Add course to Program of Studies
* View/Print Program of Studies
* View course reviews by SCU students
* Post a course review so that other students can benefit
* Online Help/FAQ section

# SCHEDU-ELP HIGHLIGHTS
* AJAX requests to load tabbed views.
* Extensive use of JQuery UI widgets.
* Reviews/Ratings page modeled similar to Yelp for ease of use by students.
* Efficient use of OO principles and design patterns in Java.
* Agile/SCRUM methodology used by team for development.
